For project 1 I used this bootstrap template:
[Business Casual](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-casual/)

In the custom css file, I added some of my own classes at the top of the file.

Here are some notes on each page.

###Home Page
  The about me is filler text for now, and the photo is just one I pulled from his facebook.
###Blog
  This is all filler content for now.  Integrating a blog is something I plan on doing in part 2 since I believe it will involve php.  The next, older, and read more buttons don't go anywhere.
###Photos
  Currently, this is just an embedded flickr album that takes the user to Flickr.  I want to abstract the photo ablum from the website so my dad will be able to upload and delete pictures easily, but I plan to make a better album view so viewers can stay on the native website.
###Calendar
  This is just a google calendar embed, but I added some CSS to make it centered and will customize it more with the look and feel of the rest of the site once my dad actually creates a calendar.
###Donate
  This button doesn't go anywhere currently.  I want to add a description of what donations will be going to and a paypal link in the future.
###Contact
  This form validates input, but the PHP form doesn't work at the moment.
