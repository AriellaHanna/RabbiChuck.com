# What Has Changed Since Part 1

* Contact has form handling and can send emails without a database
* Header is stored in php file
* Footer is stored in php file
* Nav bar is loaded from php function
* Links to each pages are stored in array in navbar function
* I tried to get a database working, but I think I broke phpMyAdmin doing a project for another class
* I wasn't able to do a lot of the cosmetic changes I wanted to because the php migration took more time than I thought it would
